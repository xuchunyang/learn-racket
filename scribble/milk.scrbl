@title{The Consequences of Milk}

That ``squeak'' was the mouse asking for milk. Let's
suppose that you give him some in a big glass.

He's a @smaller{small mouse}. The glass is too @larger{big}---@bold{way @larger{too
@larger{big}}}. So, he'll @italic{probably} ask you for a straw. You might as
well give it to him.
